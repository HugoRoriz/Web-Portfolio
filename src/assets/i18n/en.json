    "SUMMARY": "Summary",
    "SECTION-1": "Hi ! Thank you for checking out my portfolio !",
    "SECTION-2": "My name is Hugo Roriz and I'm a Front-End Web Developer .",
    "SECTION-3": "I've always been \"a bit\" of a gamer (ever since I was 4 years old and my dad gave me the controller for the first time) and that's where my passion for coding comes from . Becoming a Game Developer and build games is one of my long-term goals . I finished high school and applied for Computer Science at University of Minho . I knew basically nothing about coding, or even about computers . After taking the degree for two years and not feeling quite myself I ended up dropping out of college . Several years later I decided to start learning Web Development and got back on track !",
    "SECTION-4": "I began learning web development at the start of 2017 . Starting with video tutorials and online courses, I learned the basics of Front-End Development (from websites like Coursera/CodeAcademy/FreeCodeCamp/OdinProject and asking some developer friends that I met from college) .",
    "SECTION-5": "A few months later I enrolled in a course at EDIT. - Disruptive Digital Education, a school specialized in digital education based on Oporto, Portugal, and took the Front-End & Responsive Web Design Course . Altough the course was focused primarily on Front-End technologies, I also had lessons about good design practices (and teamwork methodologies like SCRUM) and even worked a bit with Photoshop and Sketch to build a mockup and create personas of a website concept . On the coding side of things I worked with HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/JQuery and the AngularJS framework . The course culminated with the 360º Digital Campaign that consisted in 6 teams composed of 14 people across several of the courses lectured at the school (UI/UX Designers, Digital Interaction Designers, Digital & Strategy Marketeers, Front-End Developers and a Digital Account & Project Manager), working together to create a campaign of awareness for a real brand, and to rebrand it (including direct contact with a brand representative) .",
    "SECTION-6": "After that I continued studying and started this project . You will probably find this portfolio with little content at the moment . My intent is to keep updating it as I go, not only with professional work experience (when acquired) but also personal pet projects that I might build in my spare time and possibly even some blog posts with tutorials or industry related topics here and then !",
    "SECTION-7": "I'm currently looking for my first job, so if you think you have the perfect oppportunity for me do not hesitate in contacting me ! Until then, I'll probably be building some projects for fun and practice, and, who knows, I'll even make my first \"game\" .",
    "SECTION-8": "Nevertheless and once again, thank you for taking your time to give a look at my portfolio !"
